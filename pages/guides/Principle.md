# 8 Principles of ZALORA Product Design

Design principles influence how designers approach and solve problems when building a product. Our goal is to make design principles easily recognisable and implementable within ZALORA. Always consider the following when you are designing user experiences:

Why do I pick option A over option B?
How do I achieve my design goal for ZALORA?
How can I make this design visible to the company?
How can I educate my co-workers through my design?

1. People Priority
We design with our audience’s needs in mind, prioritising them in our design decisions and harnessing user data and research to drive the solutions we create. By knowing our audience, we create the biggest difference.

2. Impactful Purpose
Our final product is a result of well-defined goals and thoughtful implementation. To do this, we ask all the hard questions at the design phase: Are we solving problems in the best way possible? Are we meeting user expectations? How can we balance customers’ desires with business needs? 

3. Content Centredness
We value content as a key driver of today’s businesses and craft our design to maximise its potential while minimising any constraints or clutter that may arise. Think layouts that are easy on the eyes and optimised across the latest platforms and devices.

4. Speed & Precision
Our users can navigate every stage of the ZALORA experience in a quick, easy and seamless manner. No unnecessary steps, no sacrifices in design usability.

5. Unified Experience
We design for consistency across a broad range of digital channels. By focusing on the future of user experience, we bring about an unprecedented level of interactivity.

6. All-Round Accessible 
We ensure that our designs are usable by all audiences, regardless of their technological readiness or level of Internet connectivity. We are relentless in our pursuit of providing a comprehensive design strategy that resonates with our audience and the market.

7. Total Adaptability
We use familiar elements and patterns for recognisability, while constantly exploring new ones that improve usability and shape meaningful connections.

8. Shared Responsibility
Everyone in ZALORA is responsible for the overall look and feel of the brand. All design decisions need to consider the viewpoints of business stakeholders and contribute to a consistent and cohesive experience across imagery, text, colours and more.
