# Best Practices
UX copy is unlike any other forms of writing. While editorial content serves to inspire and marketing copy centres on persuasion, UX writing is straightforward in its approach to meeting the customer’s needs.

The following guidelines and examples set the standards for enriching experiences that benefit our audience.

## Write for simplicity

UX copy should always be clear, succinct and free from jargon. Terminology is only permitted if it’s used across the industry (e.g. checkout, wishlist, add to bag, promo code). Our audience’s level of literacy varies, so write in a manner that is easily understandable.

## Mind the space

As copy placements vary in size, UX copy needs to occupy as little space as possible, while still retaining the full meaning. Use different font sizes for titles, bullets to illustrate key points, and avoid repeating words or phrases. Be ruthless in editing and reducing the number of words. Read your copy out loud or run it through team members to see if it makes sense.

## Use active voice

Don’t want to sound too formal? Stick to an active voice. Sentences with an active voice tend to be shorter and clearer.

**✅Active**: Look out for our confirmation email once you’ve made an order.

**❌Passive**: Once an order has been made, look out for our confirmation email.

## Encourage action

Every line of copy has purpose and should motivate the customer to take a desired action. This means using verbs (e.g. discover what’s new, update your preferences) at the start of sentences. 

## Solve the objective

Whether they’re just browsing or intent on making a purchase, customers navigate ZALORA with a distinct objective in mind. UX copy should help them meet these objectives without any hindrance or unnecessary steps.
