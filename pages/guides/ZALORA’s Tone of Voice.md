# ZALORA’s Tone of Voice
As Asia’s Online Fashion Destination, we possess a distinct brand persona and unique tone of voice to differentiate us from others. Our content must resonate with our customers at any point of their shopping journey. 

Think about who these people are, the language they use, and how we can best speak their language.

## Tone Guidelines
Identify the context in which customers are viewing our pages (e.g. post-purchase feedback, first time visiting ZALORA) and shape the copy around what they are thinking and feeling at that point. Choose the appropriate tone from below to craft your message.

### Instructional
- Step-by-step, task-oriented wordflow makes any instructions easier to follow
- Information-driven, free from fluff or clutter
- Reduce or better yet, eliminate all jargon even from the most technical features

### Informal
- Don’t be too serious or ‘heavy’ in our messages
- Treats our customers like friends 

### Direct and clear
- Make every word count to reduce the amount of ambiguity
- No superfluous words - get to the point
- Use paragraphing to add ‘breathing space’ to copy (i.e. one idea per paragraph)
