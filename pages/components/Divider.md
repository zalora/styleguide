# Divider
A divider is a line to group content to help users scan the content faster.



## Type
There are two types of a divider, based on the visual and the function. 

### Based on visual:

 **Thin divider**
 
  * To group related / same level content.
  * To divide the title and the content.
 
<insert component> -- added by developer 

(Correct)  --> image

Cart screen. Make a clear grouping per item in one seller. 

(Correct) --> image

Filter screen. Differentiate and create a hierarchy to the title and the content.

(Wrong) --> image

PDV screen. If you need to group text-only information is better to play with the spacing rather than put divider too much.


**Thick divider**

  * To group unrelated / different level content.  

<insert component> -- added by developer 

(Correct)  --> image

Cart screen. Make a clear grouping per seller. 

(Correct)  --> image

PDV screen. Divide the information between the information about the item and item suggestion. 

(Wrong) --> image

Wishlist screen. The item here is the same level so use a thin divider.


### Based on function:

**Full bleed divider**
  * Separate and divide the content into two sections.

**Middle divider**
  * To group related / same level content. 
  A middle divider cannot pair with thick divider because it has the opposite function.

## Usage
Do:

Don't:
  
  * Use too many dividers because it can confuse the users.
  * Make a random length for the divider. 
  * Stack a divider.
