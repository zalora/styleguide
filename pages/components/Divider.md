# Divider
A divider is a line to group content to help users scan the content faster. 

# Type
There are two types of a divider, based on the visual and the function. 

Based on visual:
_Thin divider_
  * To group related / same level content.
  * To divide the title and the content. 
<insert component> -- added by developer 
(Correct)  --> image
Cart screen. Make a clear grouping per item in one seller. 
(Correct) --> image
Filter screen. Differentiate and create a hierarchy to the title and the content.
(Wrong) --> image
PDV screen. If you need to group text-only information is better to play with the spacing rather than put divider too much.


_Thick divider_
  * To group unrelated / different level content.  
<insert component> -- added by developer 
(Correct)  --> image
Cart screen. Make a clear grouping per seller. 
(Correct)  --> image
PDV screen. Divide the information between the information about the item and item suggestion. 
(Wrong) --> image
Wishlist screen. The item here is the same level so use a thin divider.


Based on function:
_Full bleed divider_
Separate and divide the content into two sections. 
<insert component> -- added by developer 
 --> image
Filter screen. Full bleed divider with thin divider
--> Image
PDV screen. Full bleed divider with thick divider

_Middle divider_
To group related / same level content.
A middle divider cannot pair with thick divider because it has the opposite function. 
<insert component> -- added by developer 
 --> image
Wishlist screen. Middle divider with thin divider. 

## Usage
Do:
  * Differentiate / group the content.
  * Need to create hierarchy and divide the content into two sections.
Don't:
  * Use too many dividers because it can confuse the users.
  * Make a random length for the divider. 
  * Stack a divider.
