# Usage
Do:
  * Single select from the options given.

  * Show all the options and don't hide it.

Don't:
  * Put a background colour for the selection. 
  * Use radio button for multiple selections.
  * Collapse or hide the option. It will be better to use the dropdown. 
  
# Anatomy

For mobile can use the native interaction behaviour like a ripple effect.
