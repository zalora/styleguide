## Anatomy

* The radio icon should be on the left side. And native behaviour like ripple can be applied for the mobile platform. 

* If there is enough space, you can put the radio button side by side, like on the sign up screen.

* **The behaviour** is when the user select another option, it will de-select the current selection.




## Write for radio button
  * Start with a capital letter.  
  * Don't end it with punctuation. 
  * Keep the text in a single line. 
  * All options should be distinct from each other and not vague or misleading.
  * Use the same phrasing for all options.
