There are 2 sizes of a button, 48 px and 40 px.

And in term of the length, there also 2 types of button:
  * Full-width button
  * Fixed width button

Icon button:
  * Used for external and internal branding.
  * Used in a limited space but must have a universal meaning across the regions.
  * Don't use more than one icon in one button. 

Text and icon button:
  * Horizontal align the icon and text within the button. 
  * Use a centre align.  

# Write for button
  * Make it as short as possible but also clearly explaining the result of the button.
  * Concise and fit within a single line.
  * Between two to five words.
  * Free from any punctuation.
  * In title case regardless of platform.

A copy should:
  * Always start with a verb and continue with the subject. The subject will help to add context. 
  * Use impactful verbs to grab users attention.

 ---> the image  **continue** instead of next, **discover** instead of find out. Good example: Add New Address. Poor example: + Address.
